HL2 rcon interface:

rconaddadmin <username> <password> <powerpoints>        Adds a new admin with an own login
rcondeladmin <username>                                 Removes an already added admin
rconlistadmins                                          Returns a list of all registered admins for this rcon interface


    username is the name of the admin to login
    password is the password the admin needs to login
    powerpoints is a number between 1 and 100 - at the moment this feature is not available. Every admin has 100 powerpoints
